# Photo Capture Test Guide

## Overview
The 3D model capture functionality has been completely redesigned to provide a proper mobile-friendly photo capture experience.

## How It Works Now

### 1. Session Creation
- Doctor creates a session with patient name
- QR code is generated for the patient to scan

### 2. Photo Capture Process
When patient scans QR code, they see:
- **Clear instructions** on how to capture photos
- **Camera access** with live preview
- **Photo capture button** to take individual photos
- **Photo preview** showing captured images
- **Process button** to send photos to KIRI Engine

### 3. KIRI Processing
- Photos are sent to backend
- Backend sends photos to KIRI Engine API
- Real-time status updates during processing
- Completed 3D model is downloaded and stored

## Testing Steps

### 1. Create a Session
1. Go to the main app
2. Create a new scan session with a patient name
3. Verify QR code is generated

### 2. Test Photo Capture
1. Scan QR code with phone (or open capture URL directly)
2. Click "Start Photo Capture"
3. Allow camera access
4. Take 8-10 photos from different angles
5. Verify photos appear in preview
6. Click "Process Photos with KIRI Engine"

### 3. Monitor Processing
1. Watch progress updates
2. Check backend logs for KIRI API calls
3. Verify 3D model is created and stored

## Key Improvements

✅ **Real photo capture**: Users can actually take photos with their camera
✅ **Photo preview**: Users can see captured photos before processing
✅ **Clear instructions**: Step-by-step guidance for optimal results
✅ **Progress tracking**: Real-time updates during KIRI processing
✅ **Error handling**: Better error messages and fallbacks
✅ **Mobile optimized**: Touch-friendly interface for phones

## Expected Behavior

1. **Camera access**: Should request and get camera permission
2. **Photo capture**: Each click should capture one photo
3. **Photo preview**: Captured photos should appear in grid
4. **Processing**: Photos should be sent to KIRI Engine
5. **Completion**: 3D model should be created and available for viewing

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera not working**: Check browser permissions
- **Photos not capturing**: Ensure camera is properly initialized
- **Processing fails**: Check KIRI API key and network connection
- **Model not appearing**: Check backend logs for errors

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/capture-photos` - Send photos for KIRI processing
- `GET /test-kiri-status/{captureId}` - Check processing status
- `GET /api/download-kiri/{captureId}` - Download completed model
- `POST /api/upload/{sessionId}` - Store model in backend
